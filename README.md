# Data_Structures_1
Implementation of a randomized queue and deque. The randomized queue works the same as a normal queue, but it 
can also return a random object within the queue. Deque has the functionality of a queue and stack combined. 

# Before Use
Please note that this code uses a library of methods (seen imported at the top of the files). 
Please follow this link(https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) to download the correct path to this library so that you may be able to run and use this code correctly. 

# To Use
1. Download the files in this repo
2. Compile the files using the following:
    - "javac-algs4 RandomizedQueue.java"
    - "javac-algs4 Deque.java"
3. Run the files to see what the testing in the main methods produces to understand what is going on:
    - "java-algs4 RandomizedQueue"
    - "java-algs4 Deque"
    
 You are now able to create your own RandomizedQueue and Deque objects using these files!
