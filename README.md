# Data_Structures_1
Implementation of a randomized queue and deque. The randomized queue works the same as a normal queue, but it 
can also return a random object within the queue. Deque has the functionality of a queue and stack combined. 

# Before Use
Please note that this code uses Princeton University's library of methods (seen imported at the top of the files). 
If one runs into issues using these libraries, please import other libraries that can get the same job done. 
This code is also compiled and ran using "javac-algs4" and "java-algs4". Please use "javac" and "java" instead if these do not work.

# To Use
1. Download the files in this repo
2. Compile the files using the following:
    - "javac-algs4 RandomizedQueue.java"
    - "javac-algs4 Deque.java"
3. Run the files to see what the testing in the main methods produces to understand what is going on:
    - "java-algs4 RandomizedQueue"
    - "java-algs4 Deque"
    
 You are now able to create your own RandomizedQueue and Deque objects using these files!
